# win-kbd_us_international_ldautry

## Introduction

A keyboard layout for me I guess...

It's basically the default Windows' US International layout, but:

- <kbd>&#9095; AltGR</kbd><kbd>0</kbd> produces the degree symbol `°` as in Linux's US Int. Because I'm French speaking with Americans, I often need °C and °F.
- <kbd>&#8679; Shift</kbd><kbd>Space</kbd> produces an unbreakable space. Because it's so damn useful.
- <kbd>&#9095; Alt</kbd><kbd>.</kbd> is a macron deadkey `¯`, allowing to write [Rōmaji](https://www.wikiwand.com/fr/R%C5%8Dmaji). Because I weeb everyday.

## How to Install or Build

You can download the [latest release](/releases/latest), unzip it anywhere, and run the `setup.exe` file.



If you prefer to build  source, you can open the .KLC source file in [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=102134). You can make any changes you wish there.  
Hit the menu `Project` → `Build DLL and Setup Package`, and read carefully the popups: it will tell if errors occured, and where all the generated files are stored.
