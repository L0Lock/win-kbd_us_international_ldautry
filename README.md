# win-kbd_us_international_ldautry

A keyboard layout for me I guess...

It's basically the default Windows' US International layout, but:

- <kbd>&#9095; AltGR</kbd><kbd>0</kbd> produces the degree symbol `°` as in Linux's US International. Because I'm French speaking with Americans, I often need °C and °F.
- <kbd>&#8679; Shift</kbd><kbd>Space</kbd> produces an unbreakable space. Because it's so damn useful.
- <kbd>&#9095; Alt</kbd><kbd>.</kbd> is a macron deadkey `¯`, allowing to write [Rōmaji](https://www.wikiwand.com/fr/R%C5%8Dmaji). Because I weeb everyday.
